# About Me

Hello there! I'm Zihui Wu, a Ph.D. student from the 2022 cohort at Xidian University, diving deep into the fascinating world of AI and machine learning.

## Research Interests

My academic journey began with a focus on adversarial examples and adversarial training. In May 2023, I brought to life a method called [**AdvFunMatch**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14700). This method was groundbreaking as it trained a ResNet-18 model to achieve SOTA robust accuracy. Sadly, despite my efforts and excitement, another team managed to publish similar work concurrently, which was a tough setback. However, it has only strengthened my resolve to push the boundaries in innovative research.

### Current Passions

These days, I'm captivated by the **security of large language models**. This area is ripe for exploration and full of potential.

- **July 2024**: I unveiled [**JailbreakFunction**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17915v3), pioneering work that exposed jailbreak vulnerabilities in the function calling capabilities of large language models. This was a thrilling discovery that pushed boundaries!

- **October 2024**: I launched [**GlitchMiner**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15052), an innovative method designed to efficiently mine Glitch Tokens, ensuring models remain free from hallucination-inducing glitches.

## Future Aspirations

Looking ahead, I am eager to continue my journey of discovery and hope to contribute more groundbreaking work to the field. I am optimistic that good fortune will accompany my endeavors in the world of academia.
